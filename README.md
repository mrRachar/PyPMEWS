# PyPMEWS
A python implementation of the Pattern Matching and Extraction With Strings system.

#### TLDR;
Regex, but different: captures all repeated groups (if you want it to), slightly more consistant symbols

##### Important!
Does not cover all features of regex, yet. No ^ to start, or $ to end. Also not ready for production use, there may be a bug or two (or more).
100% Python implementation means it mightn't be the fastest module you've seen
