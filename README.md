# PyPMEWS
A python implementation of the Pattern Matching and Extraction With Strings system.

#### TLDR;
Regex, but different: captures all repeated groups (if you want it to), slightly more consistant symbols

##### Important!
Implementation practically completed, all features implemented. Does not have `^` start and `$` end yet, and also not ready for production use, as there may be a bug or two (or more).
100% Python implementation means it mightn't be the fastest module you've seen
